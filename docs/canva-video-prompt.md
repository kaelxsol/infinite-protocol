# INFINITE — Canva AI Video Generator Prompts

## PRIMARY PROMPT (paste this directly into Canva)

Create a fast-paced, dark-themed explainer video with kinetic typography and bold text animations. Black background with neon green (#c8ff00) accent color. Modern, techy, editorial aesthetic — NOT typical crypto hype.

Scene 1 (3s): Large italic text slams in: "What if you never paid for AI again?" — text fades with glitch effect

Scene 2 (4s): Quick-cut stats flying in one by one:
"ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo"
"Claude Pro: $20/mo" 
"API access: $200/mo"
Then all crossed out in red. Big green text: "$0/mo"

Scene 3 (3s): Bold headline zooms in: "INFINITE" — subtitle types out below: "Own the token. Use the AI. Forever."

Scene 4 (5s): Three steps animate in sequence:
"1. Buy $INFINITE on Solana"
"2. Connect wallet, get API key"
"3. Use Claude + Gemini — free forever"

Scene 5 (4s): Numbers cascade in fast:
"$1M daily volume"
"= $4,750/day in API funding"
"= 237,500 free API calls"
"for ALL holders"

Scene 6 (3s): Text: "Trading volume funds the AI. The more people trade, the more API everyone gets."

Scene 7 (3s): Final screen — "INFINITE" large and centered, "Coming soon on Solana" below, infinity symbol ∞

Style: Minimal, dark, fast cuts, no stock footage, text-only with motion graphics. Font: clean monospace and bold serif. Colors: black background, bright green accents, white text. Pacing: snappy and punchy, no slow fades.

## SHORTER VERSION (15 seconds — for Twitter/TikTok)

Fast dark kinetic typography video, black background, neon green accent text. Snappy 15-second explainer:

"You're paying $240/year for AI" — smash cut — "$2,880 if you build agents" — smash cut — "What if it was $0?" — pause — "INFINITE: buy the token, get free Claude + Gemini API forever" — "Trading volume funds the treasury. Treasury funds your AI." — Final: "Own the token. Use the AI. Forever. ∞"

No stock footage, text only, fast cuts, glitch transitions, modern tech aesthetic.

## ALTERNATIVE PROMPT (more detail for Canva's AI)

Make a 30-second motion graphics video with these specifications:

Background: solid black (#0a0a0a) throughout
Primary text color: white (#f0efe9)
Accent color: bright yellow-green (#c8ff00)
Warning/cost color: red (#ff5f57)
Font style: mix of elegant serif for headlines and monospace for data

Animation style: kinetic typography — text flies in, scales up, types out, and smash-cuts between scenes. Fast pacing, 2-4 seconds per scene. No images or video clips, pure text and motion.

Content flow:
1. HOOK: "Stop paying for AI." (big, centered, punchy)
2. PROBLEM: Show monthly costs stacking up — $20 + $20 + $200 = $2,880/year (in red)
3. SOLUTION: "INFINITE" appears large in green — "One token. Unlimited AI."
4. HOW: "pump.fun creator fees → API treasury → free Claude + Gemini"
5. PROOF: "$1M volume = 237,500 free API calls per day"
6. TIERS: "Hold 10K = 1,000 calls/day | Hold 1M = unlimited"
7. CLOSE: "Own the token. Use the AI. Forever." with ∞ symbol

Music mood: minimal electronic, dark, confident — not hype EDM

## TIPS FOR CANVA

- Set canvas to 1080x1920 (vertical/Reels) or 1920x1080 (horizontal/Twitter)
- Use "None" or solid black for all backgrounds
- If Canva adds stock photos, delete them — text-only looks more premium
- Add a subtle grain or noise overlay if available
- For the green color, use exactly #c8ff00
- Export at highest quality
- Add a trending minimal electronic track from Canva's audio library
