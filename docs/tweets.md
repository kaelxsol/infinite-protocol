# ∞ INFINITE — Pre-Launch Tweet Playbook

Post 1-2 per day. Mix the categories. Don't post them in order — alternate between concept, math, and builder credibility.

---

## CATEGORY 1: THE HOOK (post these first to establish the concept)

### Tweet 1 — The Thesis
what if you never had to pay for AI again

not a free trial. not a coupon.

you buy a token once, and every API call you ever make — Claude, Gemini, whatever — is funded forever by the token's own trading volume

building this now. ∞

---

### Tweet 2 — The Problem
devs right now:
- $20/mo for ChatGPT
- $100/mo for Claude Pro  
- $200+/mo for API if you're building agents

that's $3,000+/yr just to use AI

what if your investment in a token covered all of it. permanently.

---

### Tweet 3 — The One-Liner
own the token. use the AI. forever.

coming soon on Solana. ∞

---

### Tweet 4 — Framing the Category
every AI company charges you monthly

what if there was a way to pay once — and have trading volume fund your access forever

that's not a subscription. that's ownership.

∞ INFINITE

---

## CATEGORY 2: THE MATH (show people this actually works economically)

### Tweet 5 — Volume Math
let's do the math on $INFINITE:

$500K daily volume × 0.95% creator fee = $4,750/day

Claude API costs ~$0.02 per call

$4,750 ÷ $0.02 = 237,500 free API calls per day

for ALL holders. funded by trading activity alone.

this isn't theoretical. pump.fun creator fees are live right now.

---

### Tweet 6 — Savings Comparison
Claude Pro: $20/mo = $240/yr
ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo = $240/yr
API usage for an agent builder: $200/mo = $2,400/yr

vs.

buy $INFINITE once. use all of them. $0/mo forever.

the token doesn't just hold value — it IS the value.

---

### Tweet 7 — The Flywheel
the $INFINITE flywheel:

more holders → more trading → more creator fees → bigger API budget → better tools → more holders

it's self-sustaining. the more people use it, the more API everyone gets.

no VC. no treasury raises. just volume = access.

---

### Tweet 8 — Break-Even
at just $100K daily volume, $INFINITE generates ~$950/day in API funding

that's enough for 47,000 Claude API calls per day

for context, the average dev makes maybe 50-100 API calls per day

the math works at hilariously low volume

---

## CATEGORY 3: WHAT YOU GET (make the value tangible)

### Tweet 9 — The Tiers
$INFINITE access tiers:

Signal (10K tokens) → Claude Sonnet + Gemini Flash, 1K calls/day
Operator (100K) → + Gemini Pro, 10K calls/day  
Architect (1M) → All models, unlimited calls

hold more = get more. no subscriptions. no renewals.

---

### Tweet 10 — Not Just API
$INFINITE isn't just raw API keys

it's also:
→ pre-configured AI trading agents
→ wallet stalkers with AI analysis
→ launch scanners that filter pump.fun's 27K daily launches
→ sentiment engines reading CT in real-time

all tools that normally require $200+/mo in API costs. free for holders.

---

### Tweet 11 — Dev Angle
if you're a dev building on Solana:

$INFINITE gives you Claude + Gemini API access with zero billing

drop your INFINITE key into any project. build agents, bots, dashboards.

no Anthropic account. no Google Cloud billing page. no credit card.

just hold the token and ship.

---

### Tweet 12 — Trader Angle
if you're a trader:

every good AI trading tool requires you to "bring your own API key"

that means setting up billing with Anthropic or OpenAI, managing rate limits, watching costs

$INFINITE removes all of that. just connect your wallet and the tools work.

---

## CATEGORY 4: HOW IT WORKS (educate without boring)

### Tweet 13 — The Mechanism
how $INFINITE works:

1. token deployed on pump.fun with creator fee split
2. 50% of all creator fees → API treasury wallet
3. treasury funds Claude + Gemini API access
4. holders connect wallet, verify holdings, get API key
5. every API call routes through our proxy — $0 cost to you

the treasury is on-chain. fully transparent. anyone can audit it.

---

### Tweet 14 — Why Pump.fun Makes This Possible
pump.fun creator fees changed everything

before: tokens had no built-in revenue
now: every trade generates 0.05-0.95% for the creator

$INFINITE uses that revenue to fund AI access instead of pocketing it

it's the first token where the creator fee IS the product

---

### Tweet 15 — Security / Trust
"but what stops people from sharing API keys?"

→ keys are tied to your wallet address
→ balance is re-verified on every request via Helius
→ sell below the threshold? key auto-deactivates
→ you never touch our master API keys
→ treasury is fully on-chain and auditable

built for trust. not just hype.

---

## CATEGORY 5: BUILDER CREDIBILITY (show you're real)

### Tweet 16 — Building in Public
currently building:
- API proxy server that gates access by token holdings
- dashboard where holders manage keys and launch tools
- treasury agent that auto-converts SOL fees to API credits

shipping soon. the site is already done. ∞

---

### Tweet 17 — Tech Stack
$INFINITE tech stack:

→ Solana + pump.fun (token + creator fees)
→ Helius (real-time balance verification)
→ Express proxy (rate limiting + model routing)  
→ Anthropic + Google APIs (the actual AI)
→ OpenClaw agent (autonomous treasury management)

every piece exists. just had to connect them.

---

### Tweet 18 — The Aha Moment
the moment I realized this could work:

pump.fun pays creators 0.95% on every trade for small cap tokens

Claude API costs pennies per call

the revenue from a moderately traded token can fund MILLIONS of API calls

so why is anyone still paying monthly for AI?

---

## CATEGORY 6: ENGAGEMENT / CONVERSATION STARTERS

### Tweet 19 — Poll-Style
genuine question for Solana devs:

how much do you spend per month on AI API costs?

building something that makes the answer $0. forever.

---

### Tweet 20 — Hot Take
hot take: AI subscriptions are the new cable bundles

you're paying $20-200/mo for access to intelligence that costs the provider pennies

$INFINITE unbundles this. trading volume covers the cost. you just hold.

---

### Tweet 21 — Challenge
name one other token where your "investment" actually pays for a service you use every day

not staking rewards. not governance votes. 

actual utility. API calls. AI tools. trading agents.

that's $INFINITE.

---

### Tweet 22 — Teaser Before Launch
$INFINITE launches this week.

own the token. use the AI. forever.

site goes live soon. everything is built. ∞
